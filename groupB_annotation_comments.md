Most of my images were straightforward to annotate, but some proved challenging. Certain areas on the skin closely resembled cancerous lesions and appeared frequently. Distinguishing between actual cancer and mere skin pigmentation proved to be a bit challenging in some of the pictures.

What I found surprising was how different skin diseases and skin cancers can look. I always imagined an ugly, assymetrical, big mole or an ugly rash. However, some of the pictures looked pretty normal, and I would probably not think it was something weird.

All my images were good quality, but some of the skin lesions were hard to segment - I was not sure what to select and what not. Usually I just selected what looked different than the skin around it. 

A few times I got a skin lesion that had many details - this was a bit hard to segment. It almost looked like blood vessels, or like the mole was just very spread.

I found confusing some of the images that had leisure on more than one place. I was not sure if I should segment all of them or just one. 

I ended up segmenting all of them, but I am not sure if that was the right thing to do.
