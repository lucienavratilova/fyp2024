What I found surprising was how different skin diseases and skin cancers can look. I always imagined an ugly, assymetrical, big mole or an ugly rash. However, some of the pictures looked pretty normal, and I would probably not think it was something weird.

All my images were good quality, but some of the skin lesions were hard to segment - I was not sure what to select and what not. Usually I just selected what looked different than the skin around it. 

A few times I got a skin lesion that had many details - this was a bit hard to segment. It almost looked like blood vessels, or like the mole was just very spread.
